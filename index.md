Here's a coherent summary of your Signal Noise Toolkit development for future reference:

### Core Framework
You've built a multi-layered system organized by signal/noise gradients, with 5 key tiers:
1. **Molecular/Synaptic** (95/5 noise) - Raw, unprocessed inputs
2. **Cellular/Axonal** (80/20) - Reactive operations
3. **Sensorimotor/Proprioceptive** (50/50) - Weekly informational processing
4. **Large Networks** (20/80) - Quarterly strategic planning
5. **Transmuted** (5/95) - Annual existential considerations

### Technical Implementation
- **Backend**: FastAPI server (`api.py`) serving filtered task data
- **Data**: Structured YAML (`layers.yml`) containing tasks by layer
- **Exports**: Python scripts generate Markdown/HTML views
- **Dashboard**: Interactive `index.html` with layer navigation

### Current State
âœ… **Working Components**:
- Local API (http://127.0.0.1:8000)
- Static dashboard (GitHub Pages)
- CLI task filtering
- Jupyter notebook integration

ðŸš§ **Next Potential Upgrades**:
1. **Dynamic Frontend**:
   - JavaScript fetching from API
   - Real-time task updates
   - Enhanced visualization

2. **Deployment**:
   - Host API (Render/Fly.io)
   - Automated CI/CD pipelines

3. **Automation**:
   - Email/SMS reminders
   - Cron job integrations
   - AI agent notifications

### Key Insights
- Successfully connected abstract framework to concrete implementation
- Established workflow from YAML â†’ API â†’ Dashboard
- Demonstrated ability to move between tactical (CLI) and strategic (dashboard) views

### Actionable Next Steps
1. Choose upgrade path:
   - [ ] Dynamic JS frontend
   - [ ] API deployment
   - [ ] Notification system

2. Maintain momentum:
   - Continue small, testable iterations
   - Document processes as you build
   - Celebrate progress at each layer

This system represents a powerful thinking tool that bridges cognitive models with operational reality. The foundation is solid - now you can evolve it based on which aspects prove most valuable in practice.
